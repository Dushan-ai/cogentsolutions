//Technologies Used

1. Node.js & Express.js
  Backend server (running on localhost:3000) was intended to handle the form submission endpoint register.
  Helped debug the server logic to identify and fix the 500 Internal Server Error.

2. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
  Briefly addressed the need to enable CORS on the backend server to allow frontend requests from different ports during local development.

3. JavaScript (Vanilla JS + Fetch API)
  Used fetch() to handle asynchronous form submissions to the backend server.
  Managed dynamic form validation and submission behavior.

4. Bootstrap 5
  Employed Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and utility classes to create a responsive layout.

5. CSS3
  Utilized for styling the form, customizing button colors, form inputs, error messages, and loading animations.

6. HTML5
  Used to structure the registration form and layout elements in a semantic and accessible way.

Backend API Debugging
  #Investigated and began resolving a 500 Internal Server Error caused by a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:3000/register.

  #Provided suggestions for improving the backend error logging and database interaction.
